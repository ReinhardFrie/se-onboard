This section isn't going to replace any existing new starter guides but it will add to and compliment them. Just focus on what you need to know NOW and donâ€™t feel overwhelmed in having to learn everything, you won't be able to do it. Our technology moves at 100mph so keep up as best as you can using the sources covered off below.


Slack
+++++

Without doubt the definitive portal to finding absolutely anything whether that's people, process and technical content. The only challenge is reading between the lines as nothing is vetted so be cautious when reviewing replies, many people speak 'fact' and aren't always correct plus information gets superseded.  There are hundreds of channels and finding the best for you can only come from you so start with the basics listed below then follow the innevitable rabbit on the shoulder of each channel. That was a film analogy there if you hadn't pick up on it ;-).

Channels
........

Get started with these:

-  ahv

-  competitive-info

-  emea_ses

-  foundation

-  prism

-  prod-mgmt

-  security

-  sizer

-  uk_se

-  uk_founders_se

-  uk_theale_lab

Use the X-Bot App to ask questions for IT requests. For example, you may want your OKTA 2FA device resetting, a secondary e-mail address creating, WebEx enrolement, etc... It's very slick, automates SNow tickets and means quicker turnaround for you.

You can create Private and Public channels by simply clicking the \[+\] symbol. You can invite external non-Nutanix people but this would need to be completed with the assistance of IT. Head over to the Slack-Help channel or alternatively use this `SNow`_.

.. _Snow: https://nutanix.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=a7efac2a1babaf40ce2833f8cd4bcb34

Useful shortcut keys:

- \[Command] + [F]\ : Find in the current Channel
- \[Command] + [K]\ : Jump to a Channel or Person
- \[Shift] + [ESC]\ : Mark all Channels as read

Do NOT use \@\here and \@\channel whatever the reason you have. Remember that Slack channels are global and announcing a message with these operands will alert all members in the channel and likely make you unpopular with some.

When using the search function it's possible to narrow down your criteria if you happen to know the group and user, for example, use a phrase like this : ``in:#prod-mgmt from:@username``

JIRA
++++

Let's be clear about JIRA, it's not user friendly. There's so much information to be learned but it's a case of working out how to navigate it so ask an SE to walk you through. Use your OKTA login to access it.

Reviewing AOS release info
..........................

When you're asked the question, \"When did feature 'abc' get released?"\, you could go and open all the Release Notes in the Documentation section of the Support Portal alternatively you could hop into JIRA and follow these steps:

On the left-hand side click **Releases** \(the ship logo)\
